              The role of chief human resources officer is more complex than ever before. CHROs face monumental changeâ€”navigating growing employee voice, increased public airing of internal dynamics, data and privacy issues, the challenges of distributed workforces and technological advances such as AI. Yet, many find themselves without a clear roadmap for success.
