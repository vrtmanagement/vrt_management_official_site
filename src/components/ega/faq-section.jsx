      <p>
        Congratulations! Yes, you can still apply. Coursework is self-guided so
        that you can focus on areas most relevant to your business and stage.
        Founders with traction report immense value from the program, including
        the content, the community, and the accountability. On average, half of
        the accepted companies have already generated revenue.
