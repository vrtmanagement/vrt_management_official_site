# How to Add New Rajesh Tedla Image

## Step 1: Add Image File

1. Copy your new image file (the full-body portrait of Rajesh Tedla)
2. Place it in: `public/our-team/rajesh-new.jpg` (or `.png`)
3. Or place it in: `public/ega-service-landing-page/rajesh-hero.jpg`

## Step 2: Update the Code

After adding the image, I'll update the Hero component to use it.

## Quick Steps:

1. **Save your image file** with a name like:
   - `rajesh-hero.jpg` or
   - `rajesh-full-portrait.jpg`

2. **Copy it to one of these locations:**
   - `vrt_management_official_site-main/public/our-team/rajesh-hero.jpg`
   - OR
   - `vrt_management_official_site-main/public/rajesh-hero.jpg`

3. **Tell me the filename** and I'll update the code!

## Alternative: If you have an image URL

If the image is already hosted online, just provide the URL and I'll update the code immediately.
